This app is dedicated to my son Arthur who arrived 2.5 weeks early before I had a chance to write the app, doh!

I hope the app/code are useful to others.  I am not a professional programmer but the app works somehow and it is now heading towards 50,000 downloads so I guess a few folks have successfully used it.
